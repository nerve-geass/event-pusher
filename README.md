# Doc
This is just a use case of event stream with server side events, simple and working, it's a starting point and I will add some feature like VAPI checks and some styles to give more love to the UI!

# Getting Started
## Server
- Run `cd server`
- Run `npm run dev`

## Client
- Run `cd client`
- Run `npm start`
Check the ports since if you start the server before, the client will ask you to change the port from 3000 to 3001.
I prefer starting with the server.

Enjoy!!
